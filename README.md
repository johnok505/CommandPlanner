## How to use the command planner:
- Run the main method in the Scheduler.kt class
- You will be asked to provide a simulated time. Enter it in the format HH:MM
- You will then be asked to provide the command input as described in the task spec
    - e.g. 30 1 /bin/run_me_daily
- The next scheduled time and day for the command to fire will then be output. See the attached screenshot for an example

Some sample tests are also provided in the SchedulerTest class
